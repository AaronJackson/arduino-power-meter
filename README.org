* Simple Arduino Power Meter

This is a *very* simple hack to monitor your electricity
consumption. Somewhere on your power meter, there will probably be an
LED that flashes periodically. Also on your meter, will be a note
explaining how many times it flashes per kWh consumed. Mine is 3200
impressions per kWh. You'll likely want to modify this value, unless
it happens to be the same.

"Electrically" there isn't much going on.

    --------------- 3.3v
#+END_SRC

The code enables the Arduino's internal pull up resistor. The min and
max values are automatically detected, and the threshold for a pulse
is set as being in between those two points.

That is all. Have fun. :)
